      <p>In today's fast-paced software development landscape, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)  have become essential practices for teams aiming to deliver high-quality software rapidly and efficiently. CI is the practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. This approach helps identify integration issues early, reducing the time spent on debugging and allowing developers to focus on writing new features.
          CD takes CI a step further by automating the deployment of code changes to production environments. This means that once code passes all tests in the CI pipeline, it can be automatically deployed to production without manual intervention. This not only accelerates the release cycle but also ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.
